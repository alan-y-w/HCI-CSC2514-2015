  abstract = {We present Air+Touch, a new class of interactions that interweave touch events with in-air gestures, offering a unified input modality with expressiveness greater than each input modality alone. We demonstrate how air and touch are highly complementary: touch is used to designate targets and segment in-air gestures, while in-air gestures add expressivity to touch events. For example, a user can draw a circle in the air and tap to trigger a context menu, do a finger 'high jump' between two touches to select a region of text, or drag and in-air 'pigtail' to copy text to the clipboard. Through an observational study, we devised a basic taxonomy of Air+Touch interactions, based on whether the in-air component occurs before, between or after touches. To illustrate the potential of our approach, we built four applications that showcase seven exemplar Air+Touch interactions we created.},

  abstract = {Gesture typing is a popular text input method used on smartphones. Gesture keyboards are based on word gestures that subsequently trace all letters of a word on a virtual keyboard. Instead of tapping a word key by key, the user enters a word gesture with a single continuous stroke. In this paper, we introduce an implicit user verification approach for short text messages that are entered with a gesture keyboard. We utilize the way people interact with gesture keyboards to extract behavioral biometric features. We propose a proof-of-concept classification framework that learns the gesture typing behavior of a person and is able to decide whether a gestured message was written by the legitimate user or an imposter. Data collected from gesture keyboard users in a user study is used to assess the performance of the classification framework, demonstrating that the technique has considerable promise.},

In order to understand users' behaviors and attitudes towards the security of their smartphone data, we conducted 28 qualitative interviews. We examined why users choose (or choose not) to employ locking mechanisms (e.g., PINs) and their perceptions and awareness about the sensitivity of the data stored on their devices. We performed two additional online experiments to quantify our interview results and the extent to which sensitive data could be found in a user's smartphone-accessible email archive. We observed a strong correlation between use of security features and risk perceptions, which indicates rational behavior. However, we also observed that most users likely underestimate the extent to which data stored on their smartphones pervades their identities, online and offline.},

The new technique augments four simple gestures - up, down, left, and right, to the dominant digit lock technique, allowing users to either tap or perform any one of the four gestures on the digit keys. It offers in total 6250000 unique four-symbol password combinations, which is substantially more than the conventional techniques. Results of a pilot study showed that the new technique was slower and more error prone than the digit lock technique. However, we believe with practice it could get faster and more accurate. Also, most users were comfortable and all of them felt more secured while using the new technique.},

The results show that all parameters have a highly significant influence, with line visibility and pattern length being most important. We discuss implications for real-world patterns and present a linear regression model that can predict the observability of a given pattern. The model can be used to provide proactive security measurements for (un)lock patterns, in analogy to password meters.},

  abstract = {Security and usability issues with pass-locks on mobile devices have prompted researchers to develop implicit authentication (IA) schemes, which continuously and transparently authenticate users using behavioural biometrics. Contemporary IA schemes proposed by the research community are challenging to deploy, and there is a need for a framework that supports: different behavioural classifiers, given that different apps have different requirements; app developers using IA without becoming domain experts; and real-time classification on resource-constrained mobile devices. We present Itus, an IA framework for Android that allows the research community to improve IA schemes incrementally, while allowing app developers to adopt these improvements at their own pace. We describe the Itus framework and how it provides: ease of use: Itus allows app developers to use IA by changing as few as two lines of their existing code - on the other hand, Itus provides an oracle capable of making advanced recommendations should developers wish to fine-tune the classifiers; flexibility: developers can deploy Itus in an application-specific manner, adapting to their unique needs; extensibility: researchers can contribute new behavioural features and classifiers without worrying about deployment particulars; low performance overhead: Itus operates with minimal performance overhead, allowing app developers to deploy it without compromising end-user experience. These goals are accomplished with an API allowing individual stakeholders to incrementally improve Itus without re-engineering new systems. We implement Itus in two demo apps and measure its performance impact. To our knowledge, Itus is the first open-source extensible IA framework for Android that can be deployed off-the-shelf.},

Unlike one-off authentication techniques such as passwords or gestures, our technique works continuously in the background while the user uses the mobile device. To evaluate our approach's effectiveness, we conducted a lab study with 20 participants, where we recorded their interaction traces on a mobile phone and a tablet (e.g., touch pressure, locations), while they filled out electronic forms populated with UI widgets. Using classification methods based on SVM and Random Forests, we achieved an average of 97.9\% accuracy with a mobile phone and 96.79\% accuracy with a tablet for single user classification, demonstrating that our technique has strong potential for real-world use. We believe our research can help strengthen personal device security and safeguard against unintended or unauthorized uses, such as small children in a household making unauthorized online transactions on their parents' devices, or an impostor accessing the bank account belonging to the victim of a stolen device.},

  abstract = {With an increasing number of organizations allowing personal smart phones onto their networks, considerable security risk is introduced. The security risk is exacerbated by the tremendous heterogeneity of the personal mobile devices and their respective installed pool of applications. Furthermore, by virtue of the devices not being owned by the organization, the ability to authoritatively enforce organizational security polices is challenging. As a result, a critical part of organizational security is the ability to drive user security behavior through either on-device mechanisms or security awareness programs. In this paper, we establish a baseline for user security behavior from a population of over one hundred fifty smart phone users. We then systematically evaluate the ability to drive behavioral change via messaging centered on morality, deterrence, and incentives. Our findings suggest that appeals to morality are most effective over time, whereas deterrence produces the most immediate reaction. Additionally, our findings show that while a significant portion of users are securing their devices without prior intervention, it is difficult to influence change in those who do not.},

  abstract = {Today's smartphones provide services and uses that required a panoply of dedicated devices not so long ago. With them, we listen to music, play games or chat with our friends; but we also read our corporate email and documents, manage our online banking; and we have started to use them directly as a means of payment. In this paper, we aim to raise awareness of side-channel attacks even when strong isolation protects sensitive applications. Previous works have studied the use of the phone accelerometer and gyroscope as side channel data to infer PINs. Here, we describe a new side-channel attack that makes use of the video camera and microphone to infer PINs entered on a number-only soft keyboard on a smartphone. The microphone is used to detect touch events, while the camera is used to estimate the smartphone's orientation, and correlate it to the position of the digit tapped by the user. We present the design, implementation and early evaluation of PIN Skimmer, which has a mobile application and a server component. The mobile application collects touch-event orientation patterns and later uses learnt patterns to infer PINs entered in a sensitive application. When selecting from a test set of 50 4-digit PINs, PIN Skimmer correctly infers more than 30\% of PINs after 2 attempts, and more than 50\% of PINs after 5 attempts on android-powered Nexus S and Galaxy S3 phones. When selecting from a set of 200 8-digit PINs, PIN Skimmer correctly infers about 45\% of the PINs after 5 attempts and 60\% after 10 attempts. It turns out to be difficult to prevent such side-channel attacks, so we provide guidelines for developers to mitigate present and future side-channel attacks on PIN input.},

Even if only temporarily in the hands of non-entitled persons, privacy is at stake. Authentication protects against unauthorized usage. Today's operating systems of mobile devices offer authentication mechanisms. However, they are either vulnerable in some situations or not user friendly enough to be widely adopted. In this paper we suggest a novel authentication system which meets both the requirements of security and usability. For that purpose, we have analyzed existing authentication methods as well as targeting attacks. The resulting Android application SecureLock is a generic authentication system, which offers PIN and password, but also a property-based authentication method by means of NFC tags, and a novel image-based method called GesturePuzzle. The application has been evaluated and compared with other approaches for security and usability.},

At the same time, authentication using touch input is problematic, since finger smudge traces may allow attackers to reconstruct passwords. We present SmudgeSafe, an authentication system that uses random geometric image transformations, such as translation, rotation, scaling, shearing, and flipping, to increase the security of cued-recall graphical passwords. We describe the design space of these transformations and report on two user studies: A lab-based security study involving 20 participants in attacking user-defined passwords, using high quality pictures of real smudge traces captured on a mobile phone display; and an in-the-field usability study with 374 participants who generated more than 130,000 logins on a mobile phone implementation of SmudgeSafe. Results show that SmudgeSafe significantly increases security compared to authentication schemes based on PINs and lock patterns, and exhibits very high learnability, efficiency, and memorability.},

The new technique enhances security by offering more unique password combinations than the most popular ones, by making each password specific to its owner, and by reducing the threat of smudge attacks. A study comparing the new technique with the digit-lock technique showed that overall it is slower and more error-prone, but performs substantially better in short term. Also, most users felt more secure using it and wanted to use it dominantly on their smartphones. A second study confirmed that it does enhance security by making it relatively more resistant to smudge attacks and less vulnerable to situations where attackers are already in possession of users' passwords.},

To address this problem we designed a context-sensitive screen locking application which asked participants to enter a PIN/pattern only when necessary, and evaluated its impact on efficiency and satisfaction. Both groups of participants, who prior to the study either locked or did not lock their phone, adopted our application and felt that unlocking their phone only when necessary was more efficient, did not annoy them and offered a reasonable level of security. Participants responded positively to the option of choosing when a PIN/pattern is required in different contexts. Therefore, we recommend that designers of smartphone locking mechanisms should consider ceding a reasonable level of control over security settings to users to increase adoption and convenience, while keeping smartphones reasonably secure.},

	abstract = {Graphical passwords were proposed as an alternative to overcome the inherent limitations of text-based passwords, inspired by research that shows that the graphical memory of humans is particularly well developed. A graphical password scheme that has been widely adopted is the Android Unlock Pattern, a special case of the Pass-Go scheme with grid size restricted to 3x3 points and restricted stroke count. In this paper, we study the security of Android unlock patterns. By performing a large-scale user study, we measure actual user choices of patterns instead of theoretical considerations on password spaces. From this data we construct a model based on Markov chains that enables us to quantify the strength of Android unlock patterns. We found empirically that there is a high bias in the pattern selection process, e.g., the upper left corner and three-point long straight lines are very typical selection strategies. Consequently, the entropy of patterns is rather low, and our results indicate that the security offered by the scheme is less than the security of only three digit randomly-assigned PINs for guessing 20\% of all passwords (i.e., we estimate a partial guessing entropy G\_0.2 of 9.10 bit). Based on these insights, we systematically improve the scheme by finding a small, but still effective change in the pattern layout that makes graphical user logins substantially more secure. By means of another user study, we show that some changes improve the security by more than doubling the space of actually used passwords (i.e., increasing the partial guessing entropy G\_0.2 to 10.81 bit).},
